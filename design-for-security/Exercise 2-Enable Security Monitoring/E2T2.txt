#Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

[CIS.4.1] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
[CIS.2.9] Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
[CIS.4.2] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
securityhub-encrypted-volumes-98327f39 (EC2 volumes are not encrypted)

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Restrict IP address range for security groups on port 22
Enable VPC flow logging
Encrypt s3 buckets
Encrypt EC2 volumes
