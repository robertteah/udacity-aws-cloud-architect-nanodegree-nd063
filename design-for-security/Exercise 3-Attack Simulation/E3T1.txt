# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

1. UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce

2. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to my instance by guessing the SSH password

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

This finding is generated only through GuardDuty monitoring traffic on port 22.
If your SSH services are configured to use other ports, this finding is not generated.


From documentation:

"Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the
following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs"

The logs will show a large amount of requests being sent from the one instance to a specific IP indicating that the instance is being used for an SSH brute force attack.
